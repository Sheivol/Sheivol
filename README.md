# ðŸ’« About Me: 
I am studying frontend and video game development, two areas I am passionate about for their ability to combine creativity and technology. I love creating visually appealing and functional interfaces, as well as designing interactive experiences that connect with users. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to continue learning and refining my skills in both fields.
